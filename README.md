# Hololens_A1
Prepare a Hololens project that you think will be interesting and present it on class on Feb 13th. You can use some features of 
Microsoft's Hololens such as interaction with surrounding environment or objects inside the virtual world.

Tutorial:
1. Hololens projects can only be built by Unity. 
2. There is a website called Holographic Academy built by Microsoft to provide instructions on how to develop your projects using the spatial sound, geastures and
   voice control. It is a good idea to read the website before coding your project.
